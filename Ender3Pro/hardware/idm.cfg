#canbus_uuid:
# Path to the serial port for the idm device. Typically has the form
# /dev/serial/by-id/usb-idm_idm_...
speed: 40.
# Z probing dive speed.
lift_speed: 5.
# Z probing lift speed.
backlash_comp: 0.5
# Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
# the sensor response.
x_offset: -8
# X offset of idm from the nozzle.
y_offset: 15
# Y offset of idm from the nozzle.
trigger_distance: 2.
# idm trigger distance for homing.
trigger_dive_threshold: 1.5
# Threshold for range vs dive mode probing. Beyond `trigger_distance +
# trigger_dive_threshold` a dive will be used.
trigger_hysteresis: 0.006
# Hysteresis on trigger threshold for untriggering, as a percentage of the
# trigger threshold.
cal_nozzle_z: 0.1
# Expected nozzle offset after completing manual Z offset calibration.
cal_floor: 0.1
# Minimum z bound on sensor response measurement.
cal_ceil:5.
# Maximum z bound on sensor response measurement.
cal_speed: 1.0
# Speed while measuring response curve.
cal_move_speed: 10.
# Speed while moving to position for response curve measurement.
default_model_name: default
# Name of the default idm model to load.
mesh_main_direction: x
# Primary travel direction during mesh measurement.
#mesh_overscan: -1
# Distance to use for direction changes at mesh line ends. Omit this setting
# and a default will be calculated from line spacing and available travel.
mesh_cluster_size: 1
# Radius of mesh grid point clusters.
mesh_runs: 1
# Number of passes to make during mesh scan.
